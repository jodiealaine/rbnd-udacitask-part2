# What you added to Udacitask 2.0
# -------------------------------------------------------
1. What is the gem of your choice and how did you use it?

Formatador: Used it to style the display in a more readable way. In particular:
- The Title: Indent, bold and underline 
- The Types: Color coded the different item types
- The Priorities: I refactored the colorize code to use the html 'like' styling of formatador.
- Column Headings: Changed the column headers when a user filters by an item type. Not displaying the redundant columns allows the user to see only the information they are interested in.

2. Describe the 2 features you added to the project.
  a) When a Todo item is past its due date the date is displayed in red
  b) When an event has expired, and has not been deleted, the item is displayed in red.

The refactoring of the initial solutions. 
3. What two additional features did you build? Why?
  a) When a Todo item is past its due date the date is displayed in red. 
  - To make it clear if a Todo item had not been completed before the deadline.

  b) When an event has expired, and has not been deleted, the item is displayed in red.
  - To make it clear that an event is in the past.

4. Where do you still have room to grow?
	Ah so much more to grow... where do I start! I'd like to be more efficient with reading documentation. This, I know, is a constant place to grow.
